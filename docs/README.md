# Getting Started

> Create your own python zoo using this documentation. 

## Set Up
```terminal
mkdir my-zoo
cd my-zoo
touch zoo.py
mkdir images
```
> open zoo.py in your preferred IDE

## Initialize
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    zoo = dict() # creates dictionary to hold zoo animals(key) and their counts(value)
    animals = dict() # holds animals(key) and their images(value)
```
> pick 5 animals (you can add more later)
> download images for those 5 in the images folder

# Animals
> We will now take user input to add animals to the zoo and increment count accordingly
```python

```
